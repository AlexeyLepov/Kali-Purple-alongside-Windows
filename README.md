Kali-Purple alongside Windows Installation
====================================================================================================================

Make sure to back up your important data before attempting any installation. 

### `‚úÖ Step 1:` Downloading Kali Linux ISO

- Visit the official Kali Linux [website](https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
- Or use the direct [download link](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2023.2/kali-linux-2023.2a-installer-purple-amd64.iso)

### `‚úÖ Step 2:` Create a Bootable USB Drive (or DVD)

- To create a bootable USB drive, you can use software like [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/tag/v4.1) for Windows or [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Download and install the desired software.
- Connect a USB flash drive (at least `8GB` in size) to your computer.
- Run Rufus or Etcher, select the Kali Linux ISO you downloaded, and choose the connected USB drive as the target.
- Start the process, and it will create a bootable USB drive with Kali Linux.

### `‚úÖ Step 3:`  Allocate free space on your disk

If you intend to use both Windows and Kali Linux systems, you should shrink your Windows virtual disk (minimum of `20GB`):

</div>

### `‚úÖ Step 4:` Boot from the Kali Linux USB Drive

- Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer's USB port.
- Restart your computer and enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. The process for accessing BIOS/UEFI varies depending on your computer manufacturer (usually by pressing a key like `Del`, `F2`, `F12`, or `Esc` during boot).
- In the BIOS/UEFI settings, change the boot order to prioritize the USB drive (or DVD drive if you're using a DVD) over the internal storage (or just override the boot).
- Save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI settings `F10`.

### `‚úÖ Step 5:` Start the Kali Linux Installation

- When your computer restarts, it should boot from the Kali Linux USB drive.
- You'll be presented with the Kali Linux boot menu. Choose the `Graphical Install` option to start the installation process.

### `‚úÖ Step 6:` Configure Kali Linux Installation

- Select your preferred language, location, and keyboard layout, etc.

- Set up your hostname for the Kali Linux system (you can leave the domain empty).

- Create a user with a strong root password.

- Configure the network (you may need to provide details like Wi-Fi credentials if you're using a wireless connection).

### `‚úÖ Step 7:` Partitioning and Disk Setup

- Select the disk you want to use for installation.
- Select the first option: `Guided - Use the largest continuous free space`

### `‚úÖ Step 8:` Install the System

- The installer will proceed to install Kali Linux onto the selected disk.
- During the installation, you may be asked to set up the system clock and configure the package manager. Choose the appropriate options based on your location and preferences.
- The installer will prompt you to install the GRUB boot loader. Confirm the installation on the same disk where Kali Linux is being installed.

### `‚úÖ Step 9:` Complete the Installation

- Once the installation is complete, the installer will prompt you to remove the installation media (USB/DVD) and press Enter to reboot the system.
- Remove the USB drive or DVD and hit Enter to restart.
- After the system reboots, you'll be presented with the Kali Linux login screen.

### `‚ùó‚ùó Note: ‚ùó‚ùó` 

If you encounter any problems while on the stage `Select and install software` or `Install the base system`, you should click on `Go back` button and try to install the GRUB loader first. After that, click on `Go back` again and there should be no problem with installing the software.
