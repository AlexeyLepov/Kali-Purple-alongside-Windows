====================================================================================================================

### `‚úÖ Step 1:` Downloading Kali Linux ISO

- Make sure to back up your important data before attempting any installation
- Visit the official Kali Linux [website](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) and scroll down
- [Direct download link](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2024.3/kali-linux-2024.3a-installer-purple-amd64.iso)

### `‚úÖ Step 2:` Create a Bootable USB Drive (or DVD)

- To create a bootable USB drive, you can use software like [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases) or [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
- Download and install the desired software.
- Connect a USB flash drive (at least `8GB` in size) to your computer.
- Run Rufus or Etcher, select the Kali Linux ISO you downloaded, and choose the connected USB drive as the target.
- Start the process, and it will create a bootable USB drive with Kali Linux.

### `‚úÖ Step 3:`  Allocate free space on your disk

### `‚úÖ Step 4:` Boot from the Kali Linux USB Drive

- Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer's USB port
- Restart your computer and enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. The process for accessing BIOS/UEFI varies depending on your computer manufacturer. Usually, you can do this by pressing a key like `Del`, `F2`, `F12`, or `Esc` during boot
- In the BIOS/UEFI settings, change the boot order to prioritize the USB drive (or DVD drive if you're using a DVD) over the internal storage, or simply override the boot
- Save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI settings using `F10`

### `‚úÖ Step 5:` Start the Kali Linux Installation

- When your computer restarts, it should boot from the Kali Linux USB drive
- You'll be presented with the Kali Linux boot menu. Choose the `Graphical Install` option to start the installation process
- Select your preferred language, location, and keyboard layout, etc.

### `‚úÖ Step 6:` Partitioning and Disk Setup

- Select the disk that you have shrunk
- Select the first option: **`Guided - Use the largest continuous free space`**
- Review and confirm the partition changes

### `‚úÖ Step 7:` Install the System

- The installer will proceed to install Kali Linux onto the selected disk
- The installer will prompt you to install the GRUB boot loader. Confirm the installation on the same disk where Kali Linux is being installed

### `‚úÖ Step 8:` Complete the Installation

- Once the installation is complete, the installer will prompt you to remove the installation media (USB/DVD) and press 'Enter' to reboot the system
- Remove the USB drive or DVD and hit 'Enter' to restart
- After the system reboots, you'll be presented with GRUB loader

### `‚ùó‚ùó Note: ‚ùó‚ùó` 

If you encounter any problems while at the stage `Select and Install Software` or `Install the Base System`, you should click on the `Go Back` button and try to install the GRUB loader first. After that, click on `Go Back` again and there should be no problem with installing the software
